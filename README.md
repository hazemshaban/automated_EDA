# Automated EDA Tool
This Project involves building an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool that can pre-process and visualize data based on column types using Python. The tool aims to simplify the EDA process by automating the pre-processing steps and providing a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type.

The main objectives of the project are as follows:

Accepting data in various formats, including CSV, and Excel.
Pre-processing the data by identifying the data types of each column and performing appropriate pre-processing steps.
Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and more.
Generating a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and more.
Utilizing Python's Matplotlib, sklearn, and Plotly libraries to create interactive data visualizations that can be explored and customized by the user.
Designing a user-friendly command-line interface for the tool.
Implementing data pre-processing steps, developing visualization dashboards for each column type, and ensuring the tool's functionality through testing and debugging.
Data
The project will utilize the U.S. International Air Traffic data (1990-2020) available at the following URL:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/us-international-air-traffic-data â†—

The data can be accessed and downloaded from the provided Kaggle dataset.

By building this Automated EDA tool, the project aims to streamline the data exploration and visualization process, enabling users to gain insights from their datasets efficiently.
