# automated_EDA
This Project involves building an Automated EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool that can pre-process and visualize data based on column types using Python. The tool aims to simplify the EDA process by automating the pre-processing steps and providing a comprehensive visualization dashboard for each column type.
